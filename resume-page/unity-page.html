        <h3>Blackberry Winter</h3>
        <p> For the past several months, I've been working hard coding and developing my own videogame (dubbed Blackberry Winter) using the Unity engine. Unity is a 3D game engine widely used for its versatility, strength, and optimization. Unity supports custom code written in C# to support games of any shape and size.</p>

        <p>Learning to use Unity was a difficult process. While I was trying to learn the basics, I decided to try and recreate a game of Snake. I followed tutorials online and spent a lot of time reading through the Unity manual. Once I felt comfortable, I moved on to my first real game.</p>
        <p>Becuase Blackberry Winter is written in C#, it's been an excelent vehicle for practicing concepts I was taught in University, namely Object-Oriented Programming and data structures. Through this process, I have also discovered new tools such as interfaces and state machines.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, I'm not alone through this endeavor. My wife, as well as a few friends, are supporting me with original art, music, and written dialogue. Meanwhile, I write the code and manage all assets within Unity.</p>
