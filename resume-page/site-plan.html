      <h3>Unity Project</h3>
      <p>
        For the past several months, I've been working hard coding and developing my own videogame (dubbed Blackberry Winter) using the Unity engine. Unity is a free game engine widely used for its versatility, strength, and optimization. Unity supports custom C# scripts to create games of any shape and size.
        As this is my first attempt at making a videogame, getting things off the ground took some time. I spent subsantial time doing research in the beginning, but things are starting to come together. This development screenshot was taken in July of 2024.
        Because Blackberry Winter is written in C#, it's been an excelent vehicle for practicing concepts I was taught at BYU-I, particularly Object-Oriented Programming and data structures. Through this process, I have also discovered new tools such as interfaces and state machines.
        Fortunately, I'm not alone through this endeavor. My wife, as well as a few friends, are supporting me with original art, music, and written dialogue. Meanwhile, I write all scripts and assemble the assets within Unity.

      </ul>
      <h3>Other Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Much smaller in scale than my Unity videogame, I have dabbled in a couple other projects as well. Namely: Google Sheets custom Appscript & this website.
        I thought it would be fun to have a place where my friends and I could rank our favorite TV shows, videogames, albums, and other media, and then have Google Sheets average our scores together.
        I wrote some custom script to collect data from the other sheets, determine which titles are the most popular among them, and print those titles on a master sheet alongside an average review score.<br>Aditionally, I wrote several smaller functions with various goals such as displaying a list of all currently unfinished games, and randomly selecting one of those games to play next.
        Though I have no particular interest in web development, I designed and coded the HTML and CSS for this site as well. You can view my scripts using F12, or by looking on my github.
