        <h3>Other Projects</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Much smaller in scale than my videogame, I have dabbled in a couple other projects as well. Namely:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google Sheets custom AppScript functions</li>
                <li>This webpage</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </header>
  
    <main>
        <p>I thought it would be fun to have a place where my friends and I could rank our favorite TV shows and other media, and then have Sheets average our scores together.</p>

        <img id="sheets screenshot" src="images/sheets_screenshot" alt="Google Sheets screenshot">
        <p>I wrote some custom script that reads the other sheets for entries, and prints the scores listed for identical items onto a master list. From there I can get the average of those scores and find what movies / games / albums are the most popular among my friend group.</p>
        <p>Though I have no particular interest in web development, I designed and coded the HTML and CSS for this site as well.</p>
